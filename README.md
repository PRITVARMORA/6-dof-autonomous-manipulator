# 6-dof-autonomous-manipulator
The 6 degree of freedom manipulator mostly gets used to pick and place objects or to do some operations on particular objects. While operating in a congested environment there are lots of chances that arm may collide with surrounding objects while completing assigned tasks. The proposed design and algorithm are capable of finding collision free paths to traverse the end factor from one place to another place. It is very common to have a requirement to move the end factor to a non-pre -decided location, The robot is able to calculate the required states of joint to achieve that location and  orientation in real time using inverse kinematics algorithms. Thus the system begins Autonomous to operate safely, accurately, and precisely.
